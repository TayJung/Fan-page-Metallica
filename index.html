                <h1 id="info">One Story, One Band!</h1>
                <p>Metallica's history begins in Los Angeles, in 1981, when Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield decided to form the band. Ron McGovney (bass) and Dave Mustaine (guitar) complete the team. Two years later, Cliff Burton joins the band as the new bassist. The first demo, No Life'Til Leather, which contains seven songs, is recorded.</p>
                <p>Mustaine leaves and Metallica heads to New York, where the first LP is recorded, with Kirk Hammett (formerly of Exodus) on guitar. Kill 'Em All shows a band that has speed, energy and something more than the bands of the genre had been showing until then. In 1984, the second album, and much awaited, was released, Ride the Lightning, which spent 50 weeks in the Billboard Top 200, proving that Metallica is here to stay, not just another heavy metal band.</p>
                <p>Two more years and Master of Puppets is released, which sells a million copies in the United States alone. But something sad happens: during the first European tour, the band has an accident. The bus that took them skids on ice on a Swedish road, causing the instant death of Cliff Burton on September 27, 1986. Despite the loss, Metallica decides to continue and, a few weeks later, they find a new bassist: Jason Newsted (ex-Flotsam & Jetsam), which fits perfectly into the band's sound.</p>
                <p>Metallica returns to Europe in 1987, for shows that were eventually postponed because of Cliff's death. Lars' garage is converted into a rehearsal studio, where the band records Garage Days Revisited, full of covers (like Am I Evil? by metallica's favorite band Diamond Head). Also this year, they play the Donington Festival, the original Monsters Of Rock (they had played there in '85). The following year comes out Cliff' Em All, a tribute video to the bassist, and the fourth LP: ...And Justice For All, which breaks sales records, taking the band on a world tour (which, thank goodness, included Brazil, in 89).</p>
                <p>In 91 comes Metallica or The Black Album (as it is also called), which provokes different opinions, dividing not only the critics but the fans. The sound is still heavy, but there's something different, which could be a consequence of the band's new producer: Bob Rock (who worked with Bon Jovi). The album, however, is an absolute sales success and the band performs 300 shows around the world between August 1991 and July 1993 (spending again here in the country in March 1993).</p>
                <p>After a year of collective vacation, Metallica participates in the Lollapalooza festival and returns to the studio to record Load, which comes out in 96. In fact, the recordings of this album yielded many songs so that 1997's Reload , is released with the rich material that was left (which does not mean that they are "leftovers"!!! )</p>
                <p>In 1998, Garage Inc was released, a double album with only covers, including: Whiskey In The Jar (Thin Lizzy), Tuesday's Gone (Lynyrd Skynyrd) and Die Die My Darling (The Misfits). In May 1999, Metallica comes to Brazil for concerts after 6 years and despite the adverse reaction of the fans, in front of the band's changes, the tickets soon sell out.</p>
                <p>Always surprising, the band announces in 1999 the recording of “S & M”, a live album, however, with an entire orchestra accompanying them on stage. The result of the new arrangements, mixing distorted guitars with violins, was very positive and the ballad “Nothing Else Mathers” even became a video clip.</p>
                <p>Soon after, bassist Jason Newsted decided to leave Metallica, according to him, due to lack of freedom when composing and dissatisfaction with the musical direction they had been following. Shortly after, James Hetfield checked into rehab and the band was stopped for a few years.</p>
                <p>In 2003, Metallica came back with everything. Bassist Robert Trujillo (Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne) is chosen to occupy the four strings and the unprecedented "St. Anger" is released. Much heavier than the group's last works, this album brings back the heaviness and aggression to Metallica's sound.</p>
